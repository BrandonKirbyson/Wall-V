# Wall-V

![Wall-V Render](./imgs/wall-v-render1.png)

Wall-V is a 2 legged, self-balancing robot that has wheels and can jump. It is designed to be able to go up hills and have uneven height on each side. The robot uses an ESP-Wroom-32 as a fast microcontroller to stay balanced. We are planning to use either PID to maintain balance.

## Why we are building this

We are building Wall-V to experiment with self-balacing robots that have the capability to jump. Jumping will allow to robot to go over small obstacles and be more manuverable and it will have to have high torque motors to align the robot.
