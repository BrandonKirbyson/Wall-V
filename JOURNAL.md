## 6/11/25 - Initial Sketches and First CAD Design

We started by drawing an initial sketch of the robot's design. It has a motor and gear on each side which allow it to quickly move the wheels up to jump. Additionally, each side is independent so it can go up a hill and have uneven height on each side. We are planning to use an ESP-Wroom-32 as a fast microcontroller so the robot can stay balanced. We are planning to use PID or LQR to balance the robot.

## 6/12/25 - New CAD Design

We changed the CAD design to have a mount for the motor and also have the arms be properly mounted with a bearing. Additionally, we changed the style for the motor, now it has a 2 gear design that will ensure the wheels mainly stay centered under the bot.
